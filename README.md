## What was asked ?

As a brand new webdev company, we received instructions from a client to create a onepage for his event agency, called ***Main Eventers***.   


## What did we do ? 

As a team, we split the wireframe we were given in 6 parts, that then were given out to the members of our team.  
We then created a Github Project to keep track with our own part of the project and to have a global view on the whole exercice.  
All throughout this project, we pushed our modifications and commits on our Githhub repository, completed pull requests, merge requests and solved issues. 
We also have to make it responsive, so it looks good on computers :computer: and on a phone :iphone: .
